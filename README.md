# üèòÔ∏è Real Estate Price Predictor

A machine learning-powered Streamlit web app that predicts real estate property prices in major Pakistani cities using a trained CatBoost regression model. The app supports input in both **square feet** and **marlas**, with real-time price estimation based on location, size, and other property features.
